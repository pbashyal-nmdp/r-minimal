# NMDP Bioinformatics Base R Image

This is a fork of the `rhub/r-minimal` code. It enables R/Java integration. 

Build the image with:
```
docker build --build-arg R_ENABLE_JAVA=yes -t dockerhub.nmdp.org:8443/r-minimal:0.0.1 .
```

# Minimal Docker images for R

## What is R?

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.
It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and
MacOS. See more at https://www.r-project.org/

## Goals and features

The main goal of these images is to keep them minimal, so they can be used
as part of a bigger (web) application, or as a base image. Currently the
`r-minimal` image is less than 20MB compressed, and 32MB uncompressed.

All images use Alpine Linux.

The images include the `installr` tools that can install R packages from
CRAN or GitHub.

## Limitations

To keep the images minimal, they do not include a number of parts and
features that most users would prefer to have for interactive R
development:

* Recommended R packages are not installed.
* Documentation is not included.
* No readline library support.
* No X11 support.
* No Java support.
* No OpenMP support.
* No JPEG, PNG or TIFF support.
* No Cairo support.
* No Tcl/Tk support.
* No translations, only English.
* The image does not have C, C++ or Fortran compilers.

## Usage

Get the image from
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rhub/r-minimal):

```
docker pull docker.io/rhub/r-minimal:latest
```

or from [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/packages/92808?version=latest):

```
docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/r-minimal:latest
```

## Supported R versions

Currently we support the last patch version of the last five minor R
versions. The `latest` tag always uses the last R release.

image  | tags   | note
------ | ------ | ----
[R development version](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/packages/92808?version=devel)  | `devel` | Built daily
[R 3.6.2 patched](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/packages/92808?version=patched)  | `3.6.2-patched`, `3.6-patched`, `patched` | Build daily
[R 3.6.2](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/packages/92808?version=3.6.2)  | `3.6.2`, `3.6`, `latest` |
[R 3.5.3](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/packages/92808?version=3.5.3)  | `3.5.3`, `3.5` |
[R 3.4.4](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/packages/92808?version=3.4.4)  | `3.4.4`, `3.4` |
[R 3.3.3](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/packages/92808?version=3.3.3)  | `3.3.3`, `3.3` |
[R 3.2.5](https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/packages/92808?version=3.2.5)  | `3.2.5`, `3.2` |

## Dockerfile examples

One of our main goals is to be able to use `rhub/r-minimal` as a base
image, and easily add R packages from CRAN or GitHub to it, to create a
new image. Run `installr` from a `Dockerfile` to add R packages to
the `r-minimal` image:

```
FROM rhub/r-minimal
RUN installr praise
CMD [ "R", "--slave", "-e", "cat(praise::praise())" ]
```

Package with compiled code:

```
FROM rhub/r-minimal
RUN installr -d glue
```

After the package(s) have been installed, `installr` removed the compilers,
as these are typically not needed on the final image. If you want to keep
them use `installr -c` instead of `installr -d`.

Package with system requirements:

```
FROM rhub/r-minimal
RUN installr -d -t linux-headers pingr
CMD [ "R", "-q", "-e", "pingr::is_online() || stop('offline')" ]
```

Similarly to compilers, system packages are removed after the R packages
have been installed. If you want to keep (some of) them, use `installr -a`
instead of `installr -t`. (You can also mix the two.)

## Known failures

* The CRAN version (version 1.3.1) of the fs package does not build on
  Alpine Linux: https://github.com/r-lib/fs/issues/210
  This is fixed in the development version on GitHub, so install from there:
  ```
  installr -d r-lib/fs
  ```
  If you need to install a package that depends on fs, then install fs
  first.

* The current CRAN version (0.90.0.2) of the xgboost package does not
  compile on Alpine Linux. The development version on GitHub does,
  but `installr` cannot install that until Issue #4 is fixed. Some
  details:
  https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/5131

* The arrow package is hard to install, because Alpine Linux does not have
  the required libraries. Please see
  https://github.com/r-hub/r-minimal/issues/7 for the details.
